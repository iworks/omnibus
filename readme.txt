== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I display the Omnibus message anywhere? =

You can use the `omnibus_price_message` shortcode:

Just edit your product and insert it into the content:

`
[omnibus_price_message]
`

If you need the Omnibus message outside of a product, you have to add the `id` param with the product ID.

`
[omnibus_price_message id="example-id"]
`

= How can I use an action to display the Omnibus message anywhere? =

Use the `iworks_omnibus_wc_lowest_price_message` action with the product ID or on a single product page.

For a single product:
`
do_action( 'iworks_omnibus_wc_lowest_price_message' );
`

For any WooCommerce product:
`
do_action( 'iworks_omnibus_wc_lowest_price_message', $product_ID );
`

= How can I avoid saving the price log? =

When you want to skip saving a price during the insert or update product, you can use `iworks_omnibus_add_price_log_skip` filter to avoid price logging.

`
<?php
add_filter( 'iworks_omnibus_add_price_log_skip', '__return_false' );
?>
`

= How can I get lowest price log data? =

You should use `iworks_omnibus_wc_get_lowest_price` filter to get array.

<?php
$lowest_price_log = apply_filters( 'iworks_omnibus_wc_get_lowest_price', array() );
?>
`

<?php
$lowest_price_log = apply_filters( 'iworks_omnibus_wc_get_lowest_price', array(), $product_ID );
?>
`

`
[omnibus_price_message strip_tags="yes"]
`

Please add `template` param with needed format:
`
[omnibus_price_message template="This is price: {price}!"]
`
